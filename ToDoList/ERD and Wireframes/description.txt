Description for ERD:

-A user should be able to create as many lists as they want (one user to many lists).

-A list should only be associated with one user (many lists to one user). But if a user wants to invite another user to collaborate on a list, multiple users can be assocaited with multiple lists (one list to many users). So the usersxlists table exists to resolve this many to many relationship.

-A List should have a collection of tasks associated with it (one list to many tasks).
-A task should only belong a specific list (many tasks to one list).
